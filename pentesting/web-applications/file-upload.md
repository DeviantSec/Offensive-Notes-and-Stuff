# File Upload

File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its filesystem without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size.&#x20;

Attackers can leverage file upload vulnerabilities to upload malicious documents to the server intended to be downloaded by an end user or server-side script files which could potentially enable remote code execution.
