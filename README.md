My big mess of offensive security notes and miscellaneous resources. In similar fashion to other resources of this nature, all commands documented have been manually verified as working and l33t at the time of documentation.

This was inspired by both [snovvcrash](https://github.com/snovvcrash) and [sneakerhax](https://github.com/sneakerhax)'s offensive note collections. I highly recommend checking them out if you're looking for additional resources!
