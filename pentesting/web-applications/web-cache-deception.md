# Web Cache Deception

> In **web cache deception**, the attacker causes the application to store some sensitive content belonging to another user in the cache, and the attacker then retrieves this content from the cache.

### Exploitation

Extensions such as `.css`, `.js`, `.png`, etc, are usually configured to be saved in the cache. Therefore, if you were to access a non-existent URL such as `www.example.com/profile.php/nonexistent.js` the cache could potentially store response because it sees the `.js` extension.&#x20;

This is dangerous as if the application being tested is replaying the request with sensitive user contents stored in `www.example.com/profile.php`, an attacker can craft a malicious URL to steal these contents from other users.

Other things to test:

* _www.example.com/profile.php/.js_
* _www.example.com/profile.php/.css_
* _www.example.com/profile.php/test.js_
* _www.example.com/profile.php/../test.js_
* _www.example.com/profile.php/%2e%2e/test.js_
* _Use lesser known extensions such as_ `.avif`
