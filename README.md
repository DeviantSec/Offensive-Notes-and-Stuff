If you're looking for a collection of offensive security notes & miscellaneous resources then you've come to the right place.

This was inspired by both [snovvcrash](https://github.com/snovvcrash) and [sneakerhax](https://github.com/sneakerhax)'s offensive note collections. I highly recommend checking them both out if you enjoy mine!

Everything documented in this GitBook has been tested in the field. If something doesn't work as intended then please reach out to me on Twitter and let me know!&#x20;
