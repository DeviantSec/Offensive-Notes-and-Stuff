If you're looking for a collection of offensive security notes & miscellaneous resources then you've come to the right place.

This was inspired by both [snovvcrash](https://github.com/snovvcrash) and [sneakerhax](https://github.com/sneakerhax)'s offensive note collections. I highly recommend checking them both out if you enjoy mine!

## Entries

* **Tactics** - Offensive TTPs mapped to [MITRE ATT\&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/)
* **Web Application** - Web Application Vulnerabilities & Notes
* **Wireless Testing** - Everything related to hacking WiFi
* **Resources** - Resources for various topics / this section includes link dumps to useful blog posts, tooling, and more!
* **Miscellaneous** - Collection of random notes that don't have a place elsewhere in this repo - probably needs to be sorted and may change often as things find a new home!
