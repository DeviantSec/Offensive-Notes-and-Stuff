# Remote Desktop

After compromising a user on an engagement, you may observe that they have an active session on a host that you have access to. To get around this restriction without disconnecting the user, you can enable multiple sessions per user:

```bash
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\TerminalServer /v SingleSessionPerUser /d 0 /f
```
