# Network Sniffing

### PCredz

[PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) is a tool developed by lgandx that can either live capture on an interface or parse a PCAP file to extract cleartext information such as logins via FTP, POP, HTTP, or SNMP Community Strings (and much more). Additionally, this tool will also extract credit card numbers which is perfect for PCI engagements.

```bash
# Installation
sudo apt install python3-pip && sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev && pip3 install Cython && pip3 install python-libpcap && git clone https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz

# Live capture with PCredz
sudo python3 Pcredz -i eth0 -v

# Parse a PCAP file with PCredz
python3 Pcredz -f NetworkCapture.pcap

# Parse a directory of PCAPs with PCredz
python3 Pcredz -d /tmp/PCAPs/
```

### TCPDump

```bash
# Capture eth0, all ports, and write to capture.pcap
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```
