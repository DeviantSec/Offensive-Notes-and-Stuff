# Picking a Time to Send Phishing Emails

The following is based off a few different papers and statistics gathered from various sources:

* The best time to send a phishing email (in order): Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday, and Friday
* The worst times (in order): Saturday, Sunday, and Monday
* The best times to send phishing emails are 8 to 10AM

There is quite a bit of research in this area. I have had a lot of success sending phishing emails in the middle of the week. Linked below are a few articles that discuss best times for social engineering attacks that may be interesting when thinking of a time to send:
