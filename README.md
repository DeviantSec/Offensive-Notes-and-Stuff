If you're looking for a collection of offensive security notes & miscellaneous resources then you've come to the right place. In similar fashion to other resources of this nature, all commands documented have been manually verified as l33t at the time of writing.&#x20;

This was inspired by both [snovvcrash](https://github.com/snovvcrash) and [sneakerhax](https://github.com/sneakerhax)'s offensive note collections. I highly recommend checking them out if you're looking for additional resources!
