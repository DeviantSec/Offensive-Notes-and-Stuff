# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

An IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability is a type of security flaw that occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access or manipulate data objects, such as files or database records, without properly validating and authorizing the user's request. This can allow an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources by manipulating the direct object reference (e.g., changing a numeric ID in a URL to access another user's data).
