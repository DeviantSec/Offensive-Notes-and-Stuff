### The Benefits of Internal Red Teaming

In response to a Twitter thread regarding if companies budget for 100s of hours consulting fees in prolonged engagements, MG said the following:

One advantage of internal red teaming is that the $/hr isn't a focus. Rather, it becomes about lining up outcomes and value to a specific target, which is also hard to argue for without the more intimate internal relationships.&#x20;

Most companies aren't ready for this kind of thing like most aren't ready for having an 0day used during an operation. If you can't fend off the techniques being successfully run against tons of other companies, it's inappropriate to throw your money at fighting several classes above your weight.&#x20;
