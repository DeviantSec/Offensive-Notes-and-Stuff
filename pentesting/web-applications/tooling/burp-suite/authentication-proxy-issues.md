# Authentication / Proxy Issues

As of writing this page, there are a few authentication types, namely client certificates and NTLM that can't pass through Burp and need to be configured within Burp Suite itself. To configure authentication, go to settings and update the appropriate fields, the following is an example:

{% hint style="info" %}
User options > Connections > Platform Authentication. You want NTLMv2; the destination host is the host in the URL of your application
{% endhint %}
