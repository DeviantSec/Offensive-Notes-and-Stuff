# CSV Injection

CSV/Formula Injection occurs when websites embed untrusted input inside CSV files. This often occurs when a user has write access over a data entry that can be exported by a manager or administrator of the application. An attacker can craft a malicious formula to redirect the user to a phishing site or execute a reverse shell on the system.&#x20;

### Testing

Input one of the following formulas and download the document to see if it executes successfully, note that you may need to make changes to the security configuration of Microsoft Excel for these formulas to automatically execute in 2022.&#x20;

```bash
=1+2";=1+2
=1+2'" ;,=1+2
=HYPERLINK("https://parzival.sh")
=cmd|' /C calc'!xxx
```

### Mitigations

> This attack is difficult to mitigate, and explicitly disallowed from quite a few bug bounty programs. To remediate it, ensure that no cells begin with any of the following characters:
>
> * Equals to (`=`)
> * Plus (`+`)
> * Minus (`-`)
> * At (`@`)
> * Tab (`0x09`)
> * Carriage return (`0x0D`)
