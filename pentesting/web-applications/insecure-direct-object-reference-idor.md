# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

An IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability is a type of security flaw that occurs when an application uses user-supplied input to access or manipulate data objects, such as files or database records, without properly validating and authorizing the user's request. This can allow an attacker to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources by manipulating the direct object reference (e.g., changing a numeric ID in a URL to access another user's data).

This is one of the best IDOR walkthroughs I've ever watched. Z-winK does an excellent job covering different types of IDOR, providing examples, and showing how you can hunt these vulnerabilities in the wild yourself.&#x20;
