# Drupal

### Enumeration

After identifying a Drupal site, one of the first pieces of information you should try to identify is the version of Drupal running:

```bash
curl -s https://parzival.sh/CHANGELOG.txt 
```

#### Droopescan

```bash
droopescan scan drupal -u https://parzival.sh
```

### Exploitation

#### Drupalgeddon

Older installations of Drupal are vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability dubbed "Drupalgeddon". There is a Metasploit module which works well for exploiting this vulnerability:

```bash
use exploit/unix/webapp/drupal_drupalgeddon2
```
