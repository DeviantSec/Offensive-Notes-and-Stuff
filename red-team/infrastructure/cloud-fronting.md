# Cloud Fronting

### Description

Utilizing AWS CloudFront to hide your C2 servers IP address. This is ideal because the traffic will blend in with CloudFront (CDN). It also supports HTTPS which means it can be configured to communicate securely with your team servers.&#x20;

Note, this is different to domain fronting which has been rendered mostly obsolete nowadays.&#x20;
