# Subnet Enumeration

CrackMapExec enables us to extract subnet information from Active Directory assuming that we have the following:

* Valid credentials for the domain
* Can query LDAP

We can then use CrackMapExec's `subnets` module against the domain controller to return a list of subnets:

```bash
crackmapexec ldap $ip -d $domain -u $username -p $password -M subnets
```
