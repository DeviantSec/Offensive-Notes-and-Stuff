# SQL Injection

### Detecting SQL Injection

* Submitting the single quote character `'` and looking for errors or other anomalies.
* Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic differences in the resulting application responses.
* Submitting Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and looking for differences in the application's responses.
* Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.
* Submitting [OAST](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/oast) payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.
