This repository was originally titled "Pentesting Resources" but I have cleaned it up and retitled it 'TTPs' while following a similar format to SneakerHax (linked below) after seeing how their repo was formatted and presented (much nicer than mine). I highly recommend checking out their repo if you crave moar TTPs!
