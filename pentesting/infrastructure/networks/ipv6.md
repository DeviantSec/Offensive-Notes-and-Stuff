# IPv6

### Attacking IPv6

While a majority of companies do not utilize IPv6, little know that it is actually enabled by default. By using a tool such as mitm6, we can act as a malicious DNS server and redirect traffic to our attack host. This attack can be performed by using the tool [mitm6](https://blog.fox-it.com/2018/01/11/mitm6-compromising-ipv4-networks-via-ipv6/).&#x20;

The following command demonstrates basic usage of IPv6:

```bash
sudo mitm6 -d $domain
```

Additionally, the following command demonstrates running mitm6 with the `--ignore-nofqnd` flag which will ignore DHCPv6 queries that do not contain the Fully Qualfiied Domain Name:

```bash
sudo mitm6 -d $domain --ignore-nofqnd
```

#### Troubleshooting

If your testing machine was provisioned in ESXi, the following setting needs to be modified via the web console or it will not work as expected:

```bash
Networking -> VM Network -> Edit Settings -> Promiscuous Mode: Accept

# mitm6 can then be ran with the --no-ra flag.
```
