# Unconstrained Delegation

Unconstrained delegation the key distribution center (KDC) places a copy of the users TGT inside the service ticket (TGS). When the TGS is provided to the server for service access, the server opens the TGS and places the userâ€™s TGT into memory for further use. This means that the server can now impersonate the user without any restrictions.&#x20;

### Enumerating Unconstrained Delegation

```bash
# Locate Unconstrained Delegation in BloodHound
MATCH (c:Computer {unconstraineddelegation:true}) RETURN c
```

### Compromising the Domain

After compromising a server with unconstrained delegation enabled, an attacker can extract any and all TGTs from memory to impersonate them against services in the domain. This means that if we identify a Domain Administrators TGT in memory,&#x20;

### Notes

* Domain Controllers always have unconstrained delegation enabled by default.&#x20;
* Using `Rubeus` monitor command is a good way to identify any new TGTs on a compromised server.&#x20;
